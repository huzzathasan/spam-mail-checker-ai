📧 Spam Mail Checker AI

A simple yet effective spam email detection system built with Python and scikit-learn. This project uses machine learning to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content.

🚀 Features

🧠 Machine Learning-Based: Uses scikit-learn’s algorithms to train and predict.

🗂️ Text Preprocessing: Includes steps like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).

📊 Dataset Handling: Can be trained on standard email datasets like the SMS Spam Collection or Enron Email Dataset.

📥 User Input Support: Accepts custom email text to test for spam.

💡 Easy to Extend: Modular code structure for easy improvement or integration.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

scikit-learn – for ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)

pandas – for data handling

numpy – for numerical computation

nltk or re – for text cleaning and preprocessing

📈 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the dataset (clean text, remove stopwords, etc.)


2. Convert text to numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorizer


3. Train a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)


4. Test the model's accuracy


5. Use the trained model to predict whether new email input is spam

🧾 Dataset

You can use any labeled dataset with "spam" and "ham" categories. Some common options:

SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI)

Enron Email Dataset

🔮 Future Improvements

Integrate with a real email inbox (IMAP/Gmail API)

Add web interface using Flask or Streamlit

Support for multiple ML models and performance comparison

Save and load models with joblib or pickle

Multilingual spam detection
